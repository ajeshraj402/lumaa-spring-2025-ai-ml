# AI/Machine Learning Intern Challenge: Content-Based Movie Recommendation System  

I have built a simple content based recommendation system using TF-IDF & Cosine Similarity, the dataset that I've used is from Kaggle "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jrobischon/wikipedia-movie-plots".
To start, download this dataset from kaggle and importit itn to project file and just change the path to your existing path, this will load the dataset and run all the cells.

To run this file you need to download the .ipynb file and run all the cells, you can change the sample query in the last cell to your own desired query and it will return top 5 movies related to that query with similarity score, you can change the sample size to your desired value, 0 makes it to select all the rows from that dataset.

## ðŸ“Œ Dataset  
The dataset used in this project is:  
**[Wikipedia Movie Plots Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jrobischon/wikipedia-movie-plots)** (available on Kaggle).  

### **Steps to Load the Dataset:**  
1. Download the dataset from Kaggle.  
2. Place it inside your project directory.  
3. Update the file path in the code to match your local setup.
